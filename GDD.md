# OVERRULED

Overruled is a game where the players change the starting ruleset as the game progresses. Players must make up rules that dictate how the elements of the game interact with each other, how players interact with each other, and how these interactions help them to reach the winning condition:

```
Each player starts with 0 VICTORY POINTS. The first player to reach 10 VICTORY POINTS is the WINNER.
```
